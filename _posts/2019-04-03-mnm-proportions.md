I was doing some digging and found an old document from an investigation I
launched on the proportion of M&M colors in my M&M packages. It's very
important that this information be shared with the world. Sooo... here it is.

**SIDE NOTE** TIL that you can embed PDFs on Google Drive in HTML. You just
need to grab the block from google drive. Go to your PDF, click on the dots for
more, go to "Open in a new window", click on the dots again, then click
"Embed item". Ta-da.
