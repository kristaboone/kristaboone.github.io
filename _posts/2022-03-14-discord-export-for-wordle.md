Wordle- the latest internet craze that gives you the chance to compete with your friends to test your literary chops.
My friends and I like to share our daily Wordle scores in a Discord channel, and someone got the idea to hide our guesses in spoiler text so that we
could see the struggle (or epicness) of the guessing journey to find the correct 5-letter word of the day.

The process became a big tedious- click the share button on Wordle's website, paste into the Discord channel, go back to the website, edit each line
of emojis to have your guess, get the formatting right, etc.

As a programmer, I abhor tedious work that can be easily automated. And so, Discord Export for Wordle was born!
You can check it out on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/kristaboone/discord-export-for-wordle).
Below are the details from the README.

## About

Discord export for Wordle (DEW) is a web extension that will alter the functionality of the `Share` button on the NYTimes Wordle site. When the player has completed the game and clicks `Share`, instead of the clipboard containing just the emojis for the game, it will also have guesses appended to each line of emojis- hidden in a spoiler.

Take this Wordle game for example:

<img src="https://github.com/kristaboone/discord-export-for-wordle/blob/main/img/game.PNG?raw=true" alt="game" width="400"/>

Upon winning the game, the user will be shown their stats and a share button:

<img src="https://github.com/kristaboone/discord-export-for-wordle/blob/main/img/stats.PNG?raw=true" alt="stats" width="400"/>

Clicking the share button will copy this text to their clipboard to paste onto social media sites:

```
Wordle 269 4/6

ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬›
â¬›ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬›ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

DEW will edit this output so that it becomes:

```
Wordle 269 4/6

ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬› ||`steam`||
â¬›ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ ||`dates`||
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬›ğŸŸ¨ ||`teals`||
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

This output, when pasted into Discord, will render as the following:

<img src="https://github.com/kristaboone/discord-export-for-wordle/blob/main/img/discord-1.PNG?raw=true" alt="discord" width="400"/>

This allows you to share your guessing journey with your friends, but keeping things spoiler-free- let's just hope they don't take a peek at those words until they've finished their game. ;)
