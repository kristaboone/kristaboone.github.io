*A project from December 2017...*

As a part of being in Phi Sigma Rho sorority, we have our "secret sister" (i.e. secret santa)
every December. Throughout the month, we give one of our sister some gifts based on the
anonymous interests we get at the beginning of the semester. My secret sister is a fan of the
popular TV show How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM), so I decided to make her a canvas inspired by
one of the most referenced objects in the show- the yellow umbrella!
