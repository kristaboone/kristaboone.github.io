### So I'm Krista

I'm currently a graduate student at Wright State University, pursuing an MS degree in Computer Engineering.
Sometimes I get free time and if I'm not watching Friends for the 10th time on Netflix, I'll be working on some mildly interesting things.
*In case you were wondering, I like cats, coffee, and C++.*

### What is K++

This lil' website is mostly just to write about and keep track of different projects that I've worked on, or am currently working on.
I like to work on programming projects either to learn new things in the languages I'm
familiar with (C++, Python, MatLab, etc.) or to get more familiar with languages I've only worked a little with (Java, etc.).
I enjoy doing some hands-on work with electronics, since I never seem to get enough of that.
You'll also find some DIY and woodworking projects on the site (shoutout to my wonderful s.o. [Derek](http://dboone.github.io/) for inspiration and use of tools).
And lastly I dabble in some artsy projects like drawing, painting, scrapbooking, and other design-oriented projects.

Feel free to poke around and see what I've been up to!
