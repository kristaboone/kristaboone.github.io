### So I'm Krista

I recently graduated from Wright State University with my master's degree in
computer engineering. Being a recent grad, I have a lot of new-found free time,
so I can spend it working on some cool things! *In case you were wondering, I
like cats, coffee, and C++.*

### What is K++

This lil' website is mostly just to write about and keep track of different
projects I have and am currently working on. I like to work on programming
projects either to learn new things in the languages I have more experience in
(C++, Python, MATLAB, etc.) or to get more familiar with technologies I haven't
done as much with (Android development, Java, HTML/CSS, etc.). I enjoy doing
some hands-on work with electronics, since I never seem to get enough of that.
You'll also find some DIY and woodworking projects on the site (shoutout to my
wonderful s.o. [Derek](http://dboone.github.io/) for inspiration and use of
tools). And lastly I dabble in some artsy projects like drawing, painting,
scrapbooking, and other design-oriented projects.

Feel free to poke around and see what I've been up to!
