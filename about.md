### Who Am I?

Hey there! Thanks for checking out my site.

I'm Krista, a software engineer from Ohio with over 6 years development experience in a variety of languages and concepts. I graduated from Wright State
University with my master's degree in computer engineering in December of 2018 and have been working out in the field for several years.

In my freetime I enjoy playing video and board games, spending time outdoors- whether that's by tending to my garden,
going on walks in local parks, riding the local bike trails, shooting bows, or playing disk golf, doodling, and dabbling in new technologies.

### What is K++

My website is here to write about and keep track of different
projects I have and am currently working on. I like to work on programming
projects either to learn new things in the languages I have more experience in
(C++, Python, MATLAB, etc.) or to get more familiar with technologies I haven't
done as much with (Android development, Java, HTML/CSS, etc.).
Some of my projects involve doing some hands-on work with electronics, since I never seem to get enough of that.

Feel free to poke around and see what I've been up to!
